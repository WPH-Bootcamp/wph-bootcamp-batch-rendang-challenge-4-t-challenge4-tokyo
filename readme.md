# Challenge 4 - The Interactive To-Do List

# Description

In this challenge, you'll build a command-line To-Do List application using JavaScript. This challenge is designed to reinforce your understanding of core JavaScript concepts including arrays, objects, functions, control flow, and user input handling.

You will be given a basic project structure with function stubs, and your task will be to implement the logic to create a fully functional to-do list manager.

# Folder Structure

You are provided with the following folder structure:
xq

```
root/
├── index.js
├── __test__/
│ └── index.spec.js
├── readme.md
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── .gitignore
```

You will only need to modify the index.js file for this assignment.

# Assignment Objectives

## 1. Core Functionality Implementation

### `generateUniqueId()`

- Implement this function to return a unique string ID
- Combine timestamp and random string for uniqueness

### `addTodo()`

- Prompt user for todo text
- Validate input (non-empty)
- Create todo object with: id, text, isCompleted (false)
- Add to todos array
- Provide success feedback

### `markTodoCompleted()`

- Show current todos with `listTodos()`
- Prompt for todo number to mark complete
- Validate input (number within range)
- Update isCompleted status
- Handle already completed todos
- Provide feedback

### `deleteTodo()`

- Show current todos with `listTodos()`
- Prompt for todo number to delete
- Validate input (number within range)
- Remove todo from array
- Provide feedback

### `listTodos()`

- Display formatted list of all todos
- Show status ([ACTIVE]/[DONE])
- Handle empty list case
- Format output clearly

### `runTodoApp()`

- Main application loop
- Display command menu
- Process user commands
- Handle invalid commands
- Exit mechanism

## 2. Expected Output Examples

### Adding a Todo:

[ACTIVE] | Buy groceries

[ACTIVE] | Do laundry
Enter the NUMBER of the to-do to mark as completed: 1
To-do "Buy groceries" marked as completed.

### Deleting:

[DONE] | Buy groceries

[ACTIVE] | Do laundry
Enter the NUMBER of the to-do to delete: 2
To-do "Do laundry" deleted.

### Listing Todos:

--- YOUR TO-DO LIST ---
[DONE] | Buy groceries
[ACTIVE] | Study JavaScript

## 3. Testing Your Implementation

We've provided unit tests to verify your implementation. To run the tests:

```
npm run test
```

Your implementation is correct when you achieve 100% test coverage:

```
----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
File      | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s
----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
All files |   98.38 |    96.96 |     100 |   98.38 |
 index.js |   98.38 |    96.96 |     100 |   98.38 | 116
----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       10 passed, 10 total
```

the uncovered line should be the line when you call runTodoApp()

### 4. Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To run your to-do list application:

```
npm run dev
```
